title: All-nighters do not help!
description: Go to sleep! Or take a break...
---

Here is a fun story for you. When I was making the Day of Despair MVP/prototype, I pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a nullptr bug related to the items/inventory system. The bug itself isn't important but I did stay up until 5AM trying to squash it. When it was done, I went to lay down finally and my partner was saddened I did not go to bed with her.

Fast forward to about a couple weeks ago where I was working on another game and I was trying to squash a strange bug relating to Unreal Engine replication. I decided I wasn't going to stay up all night to fix it so I went to bed, this time at a 10PM instead of 5AM, and when I got back to working again, I figured it out within 30 minutes. 

So yeah, either going to sleep or otherwise taking some kind of break can be helpful for your mind trying to figure out how to solve a problem!
