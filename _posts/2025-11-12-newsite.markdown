title: New Site?

Yes my portfolio has been moved away from Google Sites to GitHub pages, powered by jekyll!

Most of what I do is text-only with a few images so I figured this would be easier to manage especially since Google Sites was starting to be a pain for scalability.

The biggest reason was probably due to my links getting blocked by filters which made it annoying to try and share my work with other people.
