title: New Site?

Yes my portfolio has been moved away from Google Sites to GitHub pages, powered by jekyll!

Most of what I do is text-only with a few images so I figured this would be easier to manage especially since Google Sites was starting to be a pain for scalability.

The biggest reason was probably due to my link getting blocked by filters which made it annoying to try and share my work with other people. Oh and easy code snippets are going to be a nicety I can already predict.
