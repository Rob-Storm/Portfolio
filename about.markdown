Welcome to my about page, here you will find more information about myself and my work.

## Background

I've been making games for over 10 years starting from when I was a child. I've used a few game engines and frameworks like Game Maker or Unity but I switched over to Unreal a few years ago and I have been content ever since. Given my previous experience with Unity and C#, I also make standalone tools with WPF and have found it to be quite an enjoyable experience. Of course I do make tools inside of Unreal Engine with Editor Utilities but thats not too different from your bog-standard blueprint class. One nice thing about making tools is that you know they are going to be used by other people and its always good to see other people use your solutions.

## Work Experience

Most of my experience comes from running my indie game studio but I have also done contract work for other indie studios.

One such contract job was at LumberJack Studios as a Programmer. We used both Unreal and Unity and I did gameplay programming for both and the occasional tool for Unreal. I also did some help with their IT issues since I have experience with that as well.
